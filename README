Luasynth - A Lua-based DSL for describing sounds and one-dimensional signals.

Luasynth allows you to easily describe and compose waveforms using only a
text editor. A domain-specific language built with Lua operator overloading
is run by a simple framework that handles caching and optimization.

Features include:
- reloader for real-time updating of playing sounds
- generating sounds from arbitrary Lua code

Dependencies:
- Linux (ALSA, pthreads)
- LuaJIT or Lua 5.1
